Part 1: Excel Data Analysis: Manipulation, Formulas and Functions

Missing Data Handling: Identify and address missing data in the movies dataset. Are there any patterns in the missing data that can be noted?
Data Sorting and Filtering: Sort the movies by year of release and by gross earnings. Then, filter the dataset to show only movies with an IMDb score greater than 8.0.
Analysis of Movie Genres: Analyze the distribution of movies across different genres. Which genre has the most movies, and which has the least?
Budget and Gross Earnings Comparison: Compare the budget and gross earnings of movies. Create a scatter plot to visualize if there's a correlation between them.
IMDb Score Categorization: Categorize movies into 'High', 'Medium', and 'Low' based on their IMDb scores. Define the thresholds for these categories.
Country-wise Movie Production: Analyze which countries have produced the most movies. Create a pie chart to represent this data.
Director Analysis: Who are the top 5 directors with the highest average gross earnings? Use formulas to calculate and sort this information.
Runtime Analysis: Calculate the average runtime of movies. How does this vary across different genres?
Top Grossing Movies by Year: Identify the top grossing movie of each year in the dataset.
Rating Popularity Over Time: Analyze how the popularity of different movie ratings (G, PG, PG-13, R, etc.) has changed over the years.
Conditional Formatting for High Budget Movies: Use conditional formatting to highlight movies with budgets above a certain threshold.
Star Impact Analysis: Investigate if there's a trend between the main star of a movie and its gross earnings or IMDb score.
Profitability Calculation: Create a new column to calculate the profitability of each movie (gross earnings minus budget).
Decade-wise Movie Analysis: Categorize movies into decades based on their release year and analyze the trend of average movie scores and gross earnings per decade.
Pivot Table for Genre Analysis: Use a pivot table to analyze the average budget and gross earnings for each genre.
Correlation Analysis: Determine if there's any correlation between the runtime of a movie and its IMDb score.
Budget Evolution Over Time: Analyze how the average movie budget has changed over the years.
Top Companies in Movie Production: Which production companies have released the most movies? Create a bar chart to represent this data.
Analysis of Movie Release by Month: Investigate if there is a preferred month or season for releasing movies. Does this trend differ by genre?
Score-based Movie Segmentation: Segment movies into different categories based on their IMDb score and analyze the average budget and gross earnings in each segment.
Time-Series Analysis of Genre Popularity: Conduct a time-series analysis to evaluate the popularity of movie genres over the years. (Organize the data by year and genre, then calculate the number of movies or total gross earnings per genre per year. Create a line chart or area chart to visualize the trends over time.)
Predictive Analysis for Future Gross Earnings: Use the historical data to predict the future gross earnings of movies based on genre, budget, and IMDb score.(Utilize Excel's advanced forecasting tools.)
Revenue and Budget Ratio Analysis Over Time: Calculate and analyze the ratio of total yearly gross earnings to the total yearly budgets of all movies released each year. How has this ratio evolved over the years covered in the dataset?(Aggregate data year-wise, calculate the total gross earnings and total budgets for each year, and then compute the ratio. Then conduct a trend analysis to understand how this profitability indicator has changed over time. Creating a line chart to visualize this trend would be essential.)
Network Analysis of Directors and Stars: Analyze the network of collaborations between directors and stars. Identify which pairs of directors and stars most frequently work together and the average gross earnings of their movies. (Use advanced data manipulation to create this matrix and then apply functions to calculate frequencies and averages.)

Part-2 Building an Excel Dashboard
Develop a comprehensive and interactive Excel dashboard that integrates key metrics and insights derived from the "movies.csv" dataset. The dashboard should provide a holistic view of the movie industry trends, focusing on movie performance, genre popularity, director and star impact, and financial analysis of movie earnings.

Dashboard Development
Importing Charts:
Charts Integration: Imported various charts into an Excel sheet to build a visually appealing and interactive dashboard.
Key Insights
Number of movies and Gross collections over decades:
Created Bar plot to count the number of movies per decade. Further created line charts to observe average gross collections and profits over decades.
Observations: We can clearly see that number of movies produced over past four decades have increased significantely. Hence the gross collections of movies over these decades has also increased.
Gross Collection Analysis:
Gross Budget ratio and Profit Difference Percentage: For observing the trends of profit difference pecentage over last forty years, line chart is considered. At first the average of the gross profit of movies per year is calculated then the gross profit difference in percentage is calculated by taking the profit difference of movies of a year from its previous year.
Gross Budget Ratio: In order to visualise the gross budget ratio line chart is used. The gross budget ratio of the movies is calculated by dividing the gross collection of movies per year by total budget of the movies produced over year.
Observations: Initially the movies were made with low budgets and they were not much profitable. Thismight have happen because of the reason that people were not much aware of movies or they were less interested in the genre of films that were produced then. During the time of 1984-1986, 1990-1992, 1996-1998 most of the movies made huge losses. From the year 2009 onwardsmost of the movies were high budget and profitable as compared to past years.
Pie Chart: Illustrated the distribution of movies across different ratings to highlight rating trends.
Number of Movies by Genre:
Bar Chart: Displayed the count of movies across various genres, identifying the most and least popular genres.

Actionables:
Use successful movies like Avengers: Endgame and Avatar in your marketing to show their success and attract attention. Partner with studios or distributors for joint promotions or exclusive content. Focus on creating and promoting R-rated content to appeal to that audience and adjust your marketing to match their interests.

Conclusion
The dashboards and analyses provide a comprehensive view of the movie industry, blending financial metrics and creative insights. From identifying key trends in decade-wise movie performance to evaluating genre popularity and production house success, the data-driven approach offers valuable perspectives for producers, investors, and creators. By visualizing financial correlations, genre distributions, and forecasting future trends, this project equips stakeholders with actionable insights to make informed decisions and strategize effectively within the dynamic world of filmmaking.
